    # [canceled] The user has ended their subscription. Subscription will not
    #   be processed.

    #   conditions for canceling the subscription have not been met. Subscription
    #   will continue to be processed until the subscription is canceled and
    #   the conditions are met.
    # [inactive] The number of installments has been fulfilled. The subscription
    #   will no longer be processed

    # This method determines if a subscription may be canceled. Canceled
    # subcriptions will not be processed. By default subscriptions may always be
    # canceled. If this method is overriden to return false, the subscription
    # will be moved to the :pending_cancellation state until it is canceled
    # again and this condition is true.
    #
    # USE CASE: Subscriptions can only be canceled more than 10 days before they
    # are processed. Override this method to be:
    #
    # def can_be_canceled?
    #   return true if actionable_date.nil?
    #   (actionable_date - 10.days.from_now.to_date) > 0

    # If a user cancels this subscription less than 10 days before it will
    # be processed the subscription will be bumped into the
    # :pending_cancellation state instead of being canceled. Susbcriptions
    # pending cancellation will still be processed.
